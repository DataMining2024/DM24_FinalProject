I lost some weight and needed a smaller size purchased on Amazon for convenience. I do not know the the quality of the material used has decreased or if these just have a healing hand label. These scrubs are pretty terrible. I only kept the 3 pairs because I need to wear something. All 3 are the same brand, style and size yet the purple pants are very tight compared to the grey and navy. The material on all of them is just bad. They catch every single piece of lint and are already getting those balls you see on an old sweater and I have worn these twice.
