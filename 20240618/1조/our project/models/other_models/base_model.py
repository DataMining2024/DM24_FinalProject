        Generates a prediction based on the input prompt and task type.

        For multiple choice tasks, it randomly selects a choice.
        For other tasks, it returns a list of integers as a string,
        representing the model's prediction in a format compatible with task-specific parsers.

        Args:
            prompt (str): The input prompt for the model.
            is_multiple_choice (bool): Indicates whether the task is a multiple choice question.

        Returns:
            str: The prediction as a string representing a single integer[0, 3] for multiple choice tasks,
                        or a string representing a comma separated list of integers for Ranking, Retrieval tasks,
                        or a string representing a comma separated list of named entities for Named Entity Recognition tasks.
                        or a string representing the (unconstrained) generated response for the generation tasks
                        Please refer to parsers.py for more details on how these responses will be parsed by the evaluator.
