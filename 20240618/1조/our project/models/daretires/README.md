# DARE_TIES_13B

This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using [mergekit](https://github.com/cg123/mergekit).

## Merge Details
### Merge Method

This model was merged using the [DARE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03099) [TIES](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01708) merge method using [yunconglong/Truthful_DPO_TomGrc_FusionNet_7Bx2_MoE_13B](https://huggingface.co/yunconglong/Truthful_DPO_TomGrc_FusionNet_7Bx2_MoE_13B) as a base.

### Models Merged
